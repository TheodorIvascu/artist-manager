# artist-manager
 A lightweight Java desktop app with a Swing interface and Hibernate ORM. It connects to a MySQL database and lets you add, edit, delete, and view artists. Built as a personal learning project to explore database persistence and simple desktop UI design.


## Requirements
- Java 17 or newer  
- MySQL **8.0 or later** (tested with 8.4)  

## How to Run
1. Make sure MySQL Server is running.  
2. Open the project in your IDE.  
3. Adjust your database credentials in `hibernate.cfg.xml` if needed.  
4. Run the main class: `com.artistmanager.Main`
5. The database will be created automatically and the Swing interface will open.

## About
Artist Manager focuses on understanding CRUD operations, Hibernate sessions, and how to connect a database to a desktop Java app.  
It’s small, functional, and built to show how a local app can handle real data in a clean and simple way.
